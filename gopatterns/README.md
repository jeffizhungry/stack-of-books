#### Go Patterns

Go patterns are not the same as OOP design patterns. These are patterns specific
to the Go language, but contains many ideas from many different areas software.

I don't belive in Rob Pike's quote that "pattern are a defficiency of the language"

Patterns allow for cleaner code and enforce better coding when used appropriately.

The benefits of using patterns:
    - Familiar patterns across different codebases
    - Modularity that comes with using the pattern
    - "miniframework" for portions of your code

The issue with using patterns:
    - People try forcing a pattern onto a simple problem. Don't do this.
    - People stop thinking of new patterhs that might be better suited for the prob.
    - Using patterns to overly abstract your code
        - abstractions are good for developers using your code
        - abstractions are a nightmare when you want to debug same code
