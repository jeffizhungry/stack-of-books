#### Go Patterns

Go patterns are not the same as OOP design patterns. These are patterns specific
to the Go language, but contains ideas such as [SOLID design principles] (https://dave.cheney.net/2016/08/20/solid-go-design).

Patterns allow for cleaner code and enforce better coding when used appropriately.

The benefits of using patterns:
    - Familiar patterns across different codebases
    - Provides "miniframework" for better modularity, security, and code quality

The issue with using patterns:
    - People try forcing a pattern onto a simple problem. 
    - People stop thinking of new patterns that might be better suited for the prob.
    - Using patterns to overly abstract your code
        - abstractions are nice for developers using your code
        - abstractions are a nightmare when you want to debug same code
