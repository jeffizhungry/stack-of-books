    * test discovery, plug-in support i.e. generating coverage reports

- [Virtual Environments] (http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
    
    * isolates python dependencies by storing a copy of the interpreter and python packages in a separate folder
    * should be dynamically generated new workspaces rather than checked into a repo
